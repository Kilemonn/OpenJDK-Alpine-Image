# OpenJDK-Alpine-Image

A docker image that uses alpine linux as a base and has openjdk installed on top. This repository aims to have lightweight official `openjdk` installations coupled with `alpine` linux with relatively regular intervals to reduce the amount of vulnerabilities in resultant images.

## Usage

The combinations of `alpine` linux and `openjdk` are created as images and published to DockerHub `https://hub.docker.com/r/kilemon/openjdk-alpine`.
